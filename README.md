Project 1

This game used HTML, CSS, Javasrcipt, JQuery

I wanted the game to look like someone was just flipping cards onto one another. So simplicity was always kept in mind.

The design is currently the greatest short coming of the project. I plan to redesigning the game with Skeleton. I would also like to add a rules page that loads on a 'hover' event.

In terms of functionality I struggled the most with implementing input that was received from the user; deck-size, answer.
